# [1] Choose a text file and simplify it as follows:
# Convert any lowercase characters to uppercase characters
# Remove anything that is not (after step a) an uppercase character (A-Z), digit (0-9), space or period.
# Your character set will now be of size 38 (26 + 10 + 2) which will simplify your substitution cipher in the next steps.

# [2] Randomly choose a substitution cipher, that is a random permutation of the 38 elements of your character set.
# (See Ch. 8, Slide 12 - except we have 38 characters instead of just 26.)
# You can use np.random.permutation to generate the permutation.
def sub_ciper(alphabet):
    return random.permutation(alphabet)


# [3] Use RSA to securely send the one-time substitution cipher (i.e. the permutation) from the client to the server.
# The client will be aware of the server’s “public key”. You can see the basics of using RSA in Python in Slide 13 of
# our supplement “LT_NetworkSecurity”. More details, if required, can be found on the Internet, including
# the official Python-RSA homepage at https://stuvel.eu/software/rsa/
# An elaborate example from TutorialPoint at https://bit.ly/2K6oWHh
